This project was my first stepping stone using vanilla JavaScript. Like literally. The process took longer than it should have. Since I lack algorithm skills and not being able to imagine how to structure the code in my head. It made things very difficult and frustrating. However, I decided to revert back into studying the basics from: reading different books along with blog posts, forums, Youtube, and other developers code logic, things started to come together.

List of Language, Framework, Tools and Version Control that helped me to build this two page website include:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap 5
4. Git
5. Github
6. Vanilla JavaScript
7.Unsplash Images
8. Pexels video
9. Google Fonts
10. Font Awesome.

The project consist of a showcase page which has a cooking video which plays continiously and a button which willtake the user to the Ordering Page.

the Ordering Page allows the user select food which they want to eat and the app sum the amount of food automatically.
